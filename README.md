# Mouse Trapped

Mouse Trapped was originally developed for the BAFTA Young Game Designers competition, in which coders, artists and story writers design their own video games. They may either focus on the concept or actually produce the game. As you can see, we have done the latter.

In the game, you navigate the mouse around a set of mazes of rapidly increasing difficulty which appear to have no end. You receive no sympathy from the scientist, who barely acknowledges that you are any more important than a glass beaker. After all, if you break, he can always get a new one.
